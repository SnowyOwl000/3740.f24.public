\item\problemnumber{NL6}{3}{44}{\ }{-}
Design a circuit with three inputs $x$, $y$ and $z$ representing the bits in a
binary number, and three outputs $a$, $b$ and $c$ also representing bits in a
binary number. When the input is $0$, $1$, $6$ or $7$, the binary output will be
the $1$s complement of the input. When the binary input is $2$, $3$, $4$ or $5$,
the output is the input shifted left with rotate. For example, $3=011_2$
outputs $110$; $4=100_2$ outputs $001$. Show your truth table, all computations
for simplification and the final circuit.\\[12pt]
