The memory unit of a computer has $256$K words of $32$ bits each. The computer
has an instruction format with four fields: an opcode field; a mode field to
specify one of seven addressing modes; a register address field to specify one
of $60$ registers and a memory address field. Assume an instruction is $32$
bits long. Answer the following:
\begin{list}{\textbf{\alph{enumii})}}{\usecounter{enumii}}
    \item How large must the mode field be?
    \item How large must the register field be?
    \item How large must the address field be?
    \item How large is the opcode field?
\end{list}
