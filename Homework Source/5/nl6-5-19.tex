Given $16$-bit instructions, is it possible to use expanding opcode to allow the
following to be encoded assuming we have a total of $32$ registers? If so, show
the encoding. If not, explain why it is not possible
\begin{list}{\textbf{\alph{enumii})}}{\usecounter{enumii}}
    \item $60$ instructions with two register operands
    \item $30$ instructions with one register operand
    \item $3$ instructions with one $10$-bit address
    \item $26$ instructions with zero operands
\end{list}
