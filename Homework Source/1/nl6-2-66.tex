Suppose we want an error-correcting code that will allow all single-bit
errors to be corrected for memory words of length $10$.
\begin{list}{\textbf{\alph{enumii}}}{\usecounter{enumii}}
    \item How many parity bits are necessary?
    \item Assuming we are using the Hamming algorithm presented in this chapter
    to design our error-correcting code, find the code word to represent the
    $10$-bit information word:\\[3pt]
    $1001100110$
\end{list}
