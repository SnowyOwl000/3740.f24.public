Show how each of the following floating-point values would be stored using
IEEE-$754$ single precision (be sure to indicate the sign bit, the exponent
and the significand fields:
\begin{list}{\textbf{\alph{enumii}}}{\usecounter{enumii}}
    \item $12.5$
    \item $-1.5$
    \item $0.75$
    \item $26.625$
\end{list}

\textbf{Answer:}\\
IEEE-$754$ uses $8$ exponent bits and $24$ significand bits, with one of those
bits implied (not stored). The exponent is stored in excess-$127$ format, and
the significand is scaled so that $1.0_2\le s<10.0_2$. The leading $1$ bit is
not stored.
