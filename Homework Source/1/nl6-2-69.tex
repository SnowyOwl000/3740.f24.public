Suppose we are working with an error-correcting code that will allow all
single-bit errors to be corrected for memory words of length $7$. We have
already calculated that we need $4$ check bits and the length of all code words
will be $11$. Code words are created according to the Hamming algorithm
presented in the text. We now receive the following code word:
\begin{center}$01111010101$\\[6pt]\end{center}
Assuming even parity, is this a legal code word? If not, according to our
error-correcting code, where is the error?\\[12pt]
