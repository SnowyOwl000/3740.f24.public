Let $a=1.0\times2^9$, $b=-1.0\times2^9$ and $c=1.0\times2^1$. Using the simple
floating-point model described in the text, perform the following calculations,
paying close attention to the order of operations. What can you say about the
algebraic properties of floating-point arithmetic in our finite model? Do you
think this algebraic anomaly holds under multiplication as well as addition?
\begin{list}{\textbf{\alph{enumii}}}{\usecounter{enumii}}
    \item $b+(a+c)$\\
    \item $(b+a)+c$\\
\end{list}
